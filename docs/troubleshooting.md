# Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Diagnostics

```bash
cc-clip doctor --host myserver
```

## Step-by-Step Verification

If image paste isn't working, run these checks **in order** to isolate the problem:

```bash
# 1. Local: Is the daemon running?
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18339/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}

# 2. Remote: Is the tunnel forwarding?
ssh myserver "curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18339/health"
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}

# 3. Remote: Is the shim taking priority over real xclip?
ssh myserver "which xclip"
# Expected: /home/<user>/.local/bin/xclip  (NOT /usr/bin/xclip)

# 4. Remote: Does the shim intercept correctly? (copy an image on Mac first)
ssh myserver 'CC_CLIP_DEBUG=1 xclip -selection clipboard -t TARGETS -o'
# Expected: image/png
```

## SSH ControlMaster Breaks RemoteForward

**Symptom:** `cc-clip connect` reports "tunnel verified", but the tunnel doesn't work in your interactive SSH session. `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18339/health` hangs on the remote.

**Cause:** If you use SSH `ControlMaster auto` (connection multiplexing), the first SSH connection becomes the "master". All subsequent connections **reuse the master** — even if you later add `RemoteForward` to your config. The old master connection does not have the port forwarding, so the tunnel silently fails.

**Fix:** `cc-clip setup` automatically adds `ControlMaster no` for your host. If you configured SSH manually:

```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host myserver
    HostName 10.x.x.x
    User myuser
    RemoteForward 18339 127.0.0.1:18339
    ControlMaster no
    ControlPath none
```

This ensures every SSH connection creates a fresh tunnel. The trade-off is slightly slower connection setup (no multiplexing), but it guarantees `RemoteForward` works reliably.

## Stale sshd Process Blocks RemoteForward

**Symptom:** `ssh myserver` shows `Warning: remote port forwarding failed for listen port 18339`. The tunnel never works regardless of how many times you reconnect.

**Cause:** A previous SSH session left a stale `sshd` child process on the remote server that is still holding port 18339. New SSH connections cannot bind `RemoteForward` to a port that's already in use.

**Diagnosis (on remote):**

```bash
sudo ss -tlnp | grep 18339
# Shows: sshd,pid=XXXXX listening on 18339
```

**Fix:**

```bash
# On remote: kill the stale sshd process
sudo kill <PID>

# Then reconnect from local
ssh myserver
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18339/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}
```

**Prevention:** Update to the latest cc-clip. The `connect` command uses `ClearAllForwardings=yes` for its internal SSH session, so it never competes for the RemoteForward port.

## Token Expired or Invalid

**Symptom:** "fetch type failed" or "token invalid" / "401" in shim debug logs. Image paste silently falls back to the remote (empty) clipboard.

**Cause:** Token TTL (30 days) expired due to prolonged inactivity, or daemon restarted and generated a new token.

**Fix:**

```bash
# Re-sync token without re-uploading the binary
cc-clip connect myserver --token-only
```

The token uses **sliding expiration** — it auto-renews on every successful request. You'll only hit this after 30+ days of zero usage.

To force a new token: `cc-clip serve --rotate-token`.

## Launchd Daemon Returns "empty" for Image Clipboard

**Symptom:** `cc-clip service install` is running, but `/clipboard/type` returns `{"type":"empty"}` even when you have an image in your Mac clipboard. Running `cc-clip serve` in the foreground works correctly.

**Cause:** macOS `launchd` does not source your shell profile, so `PATH` doesn't include Homebrew directories (`/opt/homebrew/bin` on Apple Silicon, `/usr/local/bin` on Intel). The daemon can't find `pngpaste`.

**Fix:** Reinstall the service to regenerate the plist with correct PATH:

```bash
cc-clip service uninstall
cc-clip service install
```

## Empty Image Data (API Error 400)

**Symptom:** Claude Code returns `API Error: 400 — image cannot be empty`. The conversation becomes corrupted and all subsequent image pastes fail in the same session.

**Cause:** A race condition where the clipboard content changes between the TARGETS check and the image fetch. The shim outputs empty data, and Claude Code sends an empty base64 image to the API.

**Fix:**

1. In Claude Code, run `/clear` or start a new session (the old conversation is corrupted)
2. Update to the latest cc-clip and re-run `cc-clip connect myserver`

---

## `~/.local/bin` Not in PATH

**Symptom:** `cc-clip connect` shows WARNING: `'which xclip' resolves to /usr/bin/xclip, not ~/.local/bin/xclip`.

**Cause:** The shim is installed to `~/.local/bin/` but it's not first in PATH, so the system uses `/usr/bin/xclip` instead.

**Fix:** `cc-clip connect` auto-detects your remote shell and prepends a PATH marker to the appropriate rc file. If auto-fix didn't work, add manually:

```bash
# Add to the TOP of ~/.bashrc (before the interactive guard)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Verify with `which xclip` — it should point to `~/.local/bin/xclip`.

## No Image in Clipboard

**Symptom:** Shim returns `image/png` for TARGETS but Claude Code says "No image found in clipboard".

**Cause:** You may not have an image in your Mac clipboard.

**Fix:** Copy an image on your Mac first:
- **Screenshot to clipboard:** `Cmd + Shift + Ctrl + 4` (select area) or `Cmd + Shift + Ctrl + 3` (full screen)
- **Copy from an app:** Right-click an image → Copy Image
